# MAWI — Multi-Agent Workflow Intelligence

## 🚀 What is MAWI?

MAWI is a **Multi-Agent AI Workflow Engine** designed to execute end-to-end business workflows with human-in-the-loop control.

Unlike traditional tools that only analyze data or suggest next steps, MAWI is designed to:

- detect signals
- make decisions
- generate and execute actions
- learn from outcomes

---

## 🧠 Core Philosophy

MAWI is built on one principle:

> AI should not just assist workflows — it should execute them with human supervision.

This is enabled through:

- modular specialized agents
- structured context envelopes
- tool-driven execution
- evaluation and memory feedback loops

---

## 🧩 System Architecture

The MVP follows a multi-agent, context-centric architecture:

1. **Input / Signal Layer** — detects workflow-relevant events
2. **Context Layer** — normalizes and carries state between agents
3. **Agent Layer** — strategy, action generation, execution, and evaluation agents
4. **Tool / Action Layer** — external action adapters (email/CRM stubs)
5. **Orchestration Layer** — stage sequencing, retries, audit logging
6. **Memory Layer** — short- and long-term storage for history and insights
7. **Human-in-the-loop Layer** — approval policies and action queue
8. **Evaluation Layer** — outcome scoring and feedback generation

---

## 🎯 MVP Scope

The MVP is intentionally focused on a single wedge use case:

### **SaaS Sales Deal Follow-up Execution**

Primary objective:

👉 prove that AI-driven workflow execution can improve pipeline velocity on stalled deals.

### Included in MVP

- stalled-deal signal detection
- strategy recommendation
- follow-up email/action generation
- confidence-aware human approval
- simulated execution through tools
- post-action evaluation and memory write-back

### Definition of Implemented (MVP)

A workflow is considered **Implemented** only when all of the following are present:

1. **Trigger** — concrete event/signal detection exists.
2. **Orchestration** — workflow is sequenced by the orchestrator.
3. **Execution** — at least one action/tool path is runnable.
4. **Evaluation** — outcomes are analyzed/scored after execution.
5. **Persistence** — state/outcomes are persisted for resume/audit.

If one or more criteria are incomplete, the workflow is **Partial**.

### Explicitly Out of Scope (for MVP)

- full autonomous no-approval mode
- multi-channel orchestration at scale
- advanced forecasting and optimization systems

## ⚙️ MVP Functionalities

### 1) Deal Follow-up Workflow

- detect inactive/stalled deal conditions
- produce strategy + outreach action
- queue actions for approval
- resume workflow after approve/reject

### 2) AI Action Generation

- context-aware outbound drafts
- persona/objection-aware messaging patterns
- confidence-scored outputs for routing decisions

### 3) Human-in-the-loop Control

- approve / edit / reject gate before execution
- policy checks for confidence thresholds
- auditable lifecycle history

### 4) Context Engine

- structured envelope with typed sections
- stage-by-stage updates rather than ad hoc payloads
- predictable handoff contract between components

### 5) Orchestration Engine

- sequential runner for MVP stage flow
- retry and audit hooks
- deterministic state progression

### 6) Tool Integration (Simulated in MVP)

- email dispatch adapter
- CRM update adapter
- standardized execution result payloads

### 7) Evaluation & Learning Loop (Basic)

- capture execution + reply outcomes
- generate initial insights
- persist insights to memory stores

```

---

## 🔁 Workflow Execution Flow

```text
Input -> Signal -> Context -> Strategy -> Action -> Approval -> Execution -> Evaluation -> Memory
```

---

## 🧠 Context System (Core Differentiator)

MAWI relies on a structured context envelope with sections such as:

- `meta`
- `signal_context`
- `deal_context`
- `decision_context`
- `action_context`
- `execution_context`
- `outcome_context`

Design rule:

👉 context evolves through explicit stage updates so every decision remains inspectable and debuggable.

---

## ⚡ Human-in-the-Loop Design

- lower confidence actions require approval
- higher confidence paths can graduate toward auto-execution in future phases
- all actions are traceable through queue/lifecycle/audit records

---


## 🗄️ Data Layer

MAWI includes a persistent data layer for MVP operations to:

- track workflow state across restarts
- store actions, approvals, execution logs, and outcomes
- persist context envelope snapshots for resume/debug

Current implementation uses a local SQL store for out-of-the-box execution and repository abstractions that can be upgraded to PostgreSQL/JSONB in production.

---

## 🚀 Future Development Goals

### Phase 2 — Deal Intelligence System

- richer risk detection workflows
- intervention and objection-handling playbooks
- multi-channel outreach sequencing
- deeper memory and persona adaptation

### Phase 3 — Autonomous Workflow Engine

- guarded auto-execution mode
- dynamic workflow composition/builder
- reinforcement-style learning loops
- cross-deal optimization and forecasting

For detailed roadmap items, see [`BACKLOG.md`](./BACKLOG.md).

## 🛠️ Getting Started

```bash
python main.py
```

This runs the local demo workflow end-to-end, including approval/resume behavior.

### Web API Adapter (FastAPI)

MAWI includes a thin web transport adapter in `api/router.py` that maps directly to `WorkflowAPI` service methods in `api/service.py`.

#### Endpoint Contracts

Base router prefix: `/api`

#### Error Model

When a workflow, action, or deal state cannot be resolved, endpoints return a consistent JSON error payload:

```json

  "error": "unknown_workflow",
  "message": "Unknown workflow name: foo"
}
```

Known error values:

- `unknown_workflow` (HTTP 400)
- `action_not_found` (HTTP 404)
